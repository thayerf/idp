**Lab or Group: Matsen (FHCRC), SLAB Lab (UW)**

**Estimated month and year of graduation/postdoc completion: June 2022**


## Career Goals
Identify your existing strengths and the gaps in your knowledge or experience, then think of ways to fill those gaps during your training period.

**Overall career goal (as of now -- you can change your mind later):**

I would like to work in industry as a statistician focusing on machine learning applications to novel settings (primarily neural networks). The context in which that takes place I'm still not entirely decided on. I am very interested in machine learning application to computational biology, particularly from a Bayesian perspective.


**What do you think you want to be doing in 10 years? (long-term objectives):**

I would like to be leading, or at least taking a leadership role in, solving difficult problems through developing new machine learning methodology. This could be applying existing methods to new problems, as I am doing with adaptive clinical trials, or creating new methods entirely.


**What do you want to be doing once you graduate? (medium-term objectives):**

I want to secure a job in industry. Tech is obviously the easiest field in which to accomplish this. I enjoyed my internship at Amazon,  and was especially interested in how they use statistical knowledge and creative problem solving to address modeling in complex and new contexts. While I don't think I want to be working specifically for Amazon, I feel I excel in settings which present problems that require new methods and/or careful though to solve.


**What do you want to accomplish in the next year? (short-term goals; be specific):**

I would like to present the work that Noah Simon and I have worked on. I have submitted to two conferences so far, and am waiting to hear back from one of the two. I would also like to have a manuscript ready for my adaptive clinical trials project. Finally, I would like to have fully-working software for the Mechanistic SHM project, and at least the beginnings of a manuscript.



## Acquiring of Discipline-Specific Knowledge and Research Skills
**Briefly describe your research project goals (1 paragraph):**

I am working on the use of neural networks as Bayesian estimators. So far I have finished a project wherein we used recurrent neural networks to estimate posterior quantiles. I am currently working on two projects: one which uses neural networks to learn enrollment criteria in adaptive clinical trials through reinforcement learning, and another which uses neural networks for parameter estimation in mechanistic somatic hypermutation simulation.



**What specific skills or expertise (methods, techniques, specific courses, etc) have you already acquired during the course of your project?:**

I have learned how to use software packages for neural network implementation such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. I have self-taught many concepts in immunology which are necessary for my project, specifically the different pathways of mutation that can occur in sequences. I have completed the majority of my coursework and passed my qualifying exams.


**What specific skills or expertise (methods, techniques, specific courses, etc) do you need to learn to accomplish this project?:**

I think it would be useful to learn more about immunology and genome sciences. While I took a course on proteomics, I felt that it was too advanced, and I was unable to get much out of it. I think self-teaching is the best way to go about this, because I have no previous experience in biological sciences (not even in my undergraduate work).





## Development of Career Skills

**Development of communication skills (list progress you have made in this area and specific areas to improve in the future; e.g. grant writing, manuscript writing, poster and oral presentations, science writing for the public, networking):**

I have finished my first manuscript with Noah Simon. He had already written the introduction, which helped guide me for my first time writing. I have also presented this work at both Matsen group meeting and SLAB Lab meeting. I found effectively conveying my ideas to be quite difficult. Especially for neural network research, it is very useful to have a large number of graphics. My talk had too many words, and was therefore difficult to understand. I would like to present at a conference in the next year. I think that presenting to people you do not know is a skill that I need to work on.

**Gaining experience in teaching or public outreach (list previous, current and future specific teaching opportunities, formal or informal training in didactics):**

I worked as a TA in the Fall of 2019. The course was an introduction to programming in R. Most of my work consisted of helping students with their code in-class. I still need to take the biostatistics department's consulting course, which I think will help me to better understand the types of problems people around UW generally want statisticians' help with.


**Developing mentoring skills (list previous and potential opportunities for training):**

I don't have any current or future plans for mentoring at this time.

**Other opportunities for developing skills in leadership, mentoring, time management etc.:**

NA

## Setting Goals for Progress

**Anticipated oral or poster presentations (list dates of previous and future presentations, if possible):**

I anticipate I will present at ICML or some other conference in the next year. This talk will focus on my work with Noah Simon using RNNs to estimate posterior quantiles.

**Anticipated publications (describe previous and anticipated titles/topics of manuscripts and anticipated dates of submission; include both first author and collaborative publications):**

Submitted manuscript to ICML as mentioned above.

**Applications for funding (list specific source of previous and potential funding and type of award, with expected submission dates):**

I was on the Big Data for Genomics and Neuroscience Training Grant from 2017-2019.

## Timeline for Planning to Move to the Next Step in Your Career

**Key contacts to make to explore career options and investigate leads:**

I would like to do another internship in the summer of 2021. Since I want to work in industry, and much of the cutting-edge research in machine learning is being done in the private sector, I think a second internship in the summer of my fourth year will help me decide which type of company I would like to work for.

**Potential sources for letters of reference (cultivate these relationships early):**

Obviously my main mentors and advisors (Erick Matsen and Noah Simon) are the best options for this.

**Development of CV, research summary, etc.:**

I would like to update my CV 2-3 times per year instead of once as I currently do. It is difficult for me to aggregate all the things I've done throughout the year, so splitting it up into smaller pieces will be useful.

**Other actions to facilitate the move to your next position (e.g. attending Biosciences career seminars, meeting with the Director of the Office of Scientific Career Development, other professional development, informational interviews, networking):**

I need to work on becoming more organized. This includes both how I split my time between the projects I am working on, and keeping my thoughts and notes on these projects organized in a way that can be easily referenced. Most importantly, however, I need to work on organizing my code, so when I come back to it weeks or months later, I can understand what I was thinking when I wrote the code.
